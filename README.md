# example-analysis-net

Here you have a basic console app that uses analysis-net as a dependency. In the console example, you have a C# program source code that is compiled in order to do a live variable analysis.

# Setup dependencies
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
# For Windows
1. Directly open Console/Console.sln using Visual Studio (it worked for Visual Studio 2019).
Visual Studio should automatically install nuget dependecies. If it doen't load them, do it yourself.
Go to the Solution Explorer tab, right click on the solution and then left click "Restore NuGet packages".

# For Linux 
Todo.
